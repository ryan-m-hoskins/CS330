1. How do I approach designing software?
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
- What design process did you follow for your project work?
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

2. How do I approach developing programs?
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- How did iteration factor into your development?
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Designing software begins with first understanding what it is intended to do, which can be accomplished through clearly defined requirements for any project worked on. I'm not sure that I followed any particular design process, as the project was largely already implemented, but required more detailed work be incorporated. With that said, breaking the design process down into smaller components was heavily used throughout the project. By recognizing the larger components of the project, such as object creation, implementing textures, deciding on materials, creating lighting, and determining how the lighting would interact with the scene helps break down a once overwhelming project into smaller and easier to accomplish components within it. I also frequently testing throughout the design process to ensure things looked as they should look.

Developing software can manifest in any number of ways or through any number of systems, as seen the many project management systems that have developed over the last few decades. There are Agile systems, Waterfall, SCRUM, Kanban, etc., all of which approach projects in different, but similar, ways. Throughout these systems, several software designing techniques or strategies can be implemented. Working on this project introduced the use of APIs and strengthened my understanding of Object-oriented programming. It's important to first develop a clear understanding of what needs to be accomplished. This can be accomplished through the use of clearly defined requirements that help create the framework of what the intended software or project much do. With that said, it can be incredibly helpful to implement clear documentation into any design process and calling on existing design patterns throughout the pattern, such as the use of the Phong model and such. Iteration took place by repeatedly testing over, and over, and over, and over. 

Computational graphics and visualizations may not be prevalent in my intended hobbies or professional pursuits, but they certainly provide value either way. Mathematics play an important role in computer science and this course heavily utilized it. If anything, working with a large and complicated project provided essential experience and skills that can be applied to any other project - as well as any career pursuits.
